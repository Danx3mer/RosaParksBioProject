	<h1>A life lesson I learned:</h1>
	<h4>I learned that you have to stand up for what you believe is the right thing to do. You have to believe in yourself and what you believe is right. You have to explain to others why you believe what you believe is the right thing to do. You have to fight for your own rights and not step down from the fight. You must trust yourself and your heart. </h4>
